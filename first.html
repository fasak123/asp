        <p>The heart is a muscular organ in most animals, which pumps blood through the blood vessels of the circulatory system. The pumped blood carries oxygen and nutrients to the body, while carrying metabolic waste such as carbon dioxide to the lungs.In humans, the heart is approximately the size of a closed fist and is located between the lungs, in the middle compartment of the chest.</p>
    
   <p>In humans, other mammals, and birds, the heart is divided into four chambers: upper left and right atria and lower left and right ventricles.Commonly the right atrium and ventricle are referred together as the right heart and their left counterparts as the left heart.Fish, in contrast, have two chambers, an atrium and a ventricle, while reptiles have three chambers. In a healthy heart blood flows one way through the heart due to heart valves, which prevent backflow.The heart is enclosed in a protective sac, the pericardium, which also contains a small amount of fluid. The wall of the heart is made up of three layers: epicardium, myocardium, and endocardium.</p> 
        <p>As per the recent study by WHO, heart related diseases are increasing. 17.9 million people die every-year due to this. With growing population, it gets further difficult to diagnose and start treatment at early stage. But due to the recent advancement in technology, Machine Learning techniques have accelerated the health sector by multiple researches. Thus, the objective of this paper is to build a ML model for heart disease prediction based on the related parameters. We have used a benchmark dataset of UCI Heart disease prediction for this research work, which consist of 14 different parameters related to Heart Disease. Machine Learning algorithms such as Random Forest </p>
